# Control flow Definition
## Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script so control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.example as below :

```
if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
```
