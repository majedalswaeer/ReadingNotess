# General introduction to wireframes and the tools used to create them
## -Wireframe: a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.Also, a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface.
## -Advices when we are creating wireframes :
### ** 1- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change. **
### ** 2- With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. **
### ** 3- Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions, check the following example :**![img](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dbb80f2f6a5dafa25f702ad00bc429057fb59cec/52716/en/blog/uploads/versions/samuel-student-wireframe---x----972-715x---.png)

## -Tools for wireframing

## -Six steps to make your wireframe
### ** 1- Do your research **
### ** 2- Prepare your research for quick reference **
### ** 3- Make sure you have your user flow mapped out **
### ** 4- Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate **

# what is HTML?
## -HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. 
# what is Semantics?
## -In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
