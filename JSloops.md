# JS Loops and iterations
## Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript, here are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times,Also,  it's possible that number could be zero, an explaintation below:

```

for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
```
